# mehmo

Log your thoughts.  Examine your thinking. Move ideas forward.

## Intro

Mehmo is a note taking app that allows you to log thoughts. Then you can read your thought logs to understand what you were thinking at a point in time.  This allows you to introspect your own thought patterns, which can help to improve your thought process over time.

Thoughts you enter into the app are timestamped and Mehmo provides no way for you to edit note entries, though this can be done easily with normal command line tools.  Notes are just timestamed log files.
